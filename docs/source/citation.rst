We are grateful to Marica Branchesi, Jan Harms, Ulyana Dupletsa, Samuele Ronchini and the GSSI group for extremely useful discussions and comparisons of our respective codes (see `GWFish <https://github.com/janosch314/GWFish>`_) and results, all along this project.
We also thank Ssohrab Borhanian and B. S. Sathyaprakash for comparisons with `GWBENCH <https://gitlab.com/sborhanian/gwbench/-/tree/master/gwbench>`_,
and Andrea Maselli, Ik Siong Heng, Mauro Pieroni and the members of the ET Observational Science Board (OSB) Div. 9 for hosting discussions about comparisons of Fisher codes.
