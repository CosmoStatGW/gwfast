# gwfast
Fisher Information Matrix package for GW cosmology, written in Python and based on automatic differentiation.

The detail of implementations and results can be found in the papers [arXiv:2207.02771](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02771>) and [arXiv:2207.06910](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06910>).

Waveforms are also separatley released as [WF4Py](<https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py>).

Developed by [Francesco Iacovelli](<https://github.com/FrancescoIacovelli>) and [Michele Mancarella](<https://github.com/Mik3M4n>).

## Documentation

gwfast has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs [here](<https://gwfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>), and it can also be built from the ```docs``` directory.

## Installation
To install the package without cloning the git repository, and a CPU-only version of JAX 

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install gwfast
```

or 

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade "jax[cpu]" 
pip install git+https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/gwfast
```

To install a JAX version for GPU or TPU proceed as explained in [https://github.com/google/jax#installation](<https://github.com/google/jax#installation>).


## Usage

All details are reported in the accompanying paper [arXiv:2207.06910](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06910>) and some examples are in the [gwfast_tutorial](<https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/gwfast/blob/master/notebooks/gwfast_tutorial.ipynb>) notebook.

To initialise a *waveform* object simply run, e.g.

```python
mywf = waveforms.IMRPhenomD()
```
(more details on the waveforms are available in their dedicated git repository [WF4Py](<https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py>))

and to build a *signal* object 

```python
MyDet = signal.GWSignal(mywf, psd_path= 'path/to/Detector/psd',
 						detector_shape = 'L', det_lat=43.6, 
 						det_long=10.5, det_xax=115.) 
```

More signal objects can be used to form a *network*

```python
myNet = network.DetNet({'Det1':MyDet1, 'Det2':MyDet2, ...}) 
```

Then computing **SNRs** and **Fisher matrices** is as easy as

```python
SNRs = myNet.SNR(events) 
FisherMatrs = myNet.FisherMatr(events)  
```
where ```events ``` is a dictionary containing the parameters of the chosen events.

Finally, to compute the **covariance matrices** it is sufficient to

```python
CovMatr(FisherMatrs, events) 
```
