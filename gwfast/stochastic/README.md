# Stochastic tools module

This module contains some practical functions that help the user to quickly compute useful quantities related to stochastic gravitational wave searches such as:

- Overlap Reduction Function (ORF).
- Power-Law integrated Sensitivity (PLS).
- Minimum frequency and mimium value of the PLS of a given configuration.
- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a given stochastic background spectrum.
- Mimimum detectable energy density by a single detector.

See the tutorial jupyter notebook `../../notebooks/Stochastic_tutorial.ipynb` for more information.
